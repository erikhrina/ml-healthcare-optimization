# ML-Healthcare-Optimization

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on improving healthcare decision-making. The project addresses three main tasks:
1. Predicting hospital stay durations.
2. Identifying patients at risk of readmission.
3. Grouping patients into meaningful clusters.

## Repository Structure  

```bash
├── Creative_Brief.ipynb # Jupyter notebook containing EDA and project workflow
├── Report.pdf # Detailed CRISP-DM project report
├── Data/
│ ├── diabetic_data.csv # Main dataset for analysis
│ ├── IDS_mapping.csv # Feature mapping of diabetic data
```

## Data  
The primary dataset, `diabetic_data.csv`, includes patient records with features relevant to diabetes care and hospital management. The file,`IDS_mapping.csv` provides mappings for categorical features. Both files are stored in the `Data/` directory.  

## How to Use  
1. Open the `Creative_Brief.ipynb` file for a detailed walkthrough of the data analysis and model development process.  
2. Refer to `Report.pdf` for a detailed report of the project workflow and findings.  
3. Explore the `Data/` directory for datasets.
